My career before this was just managing a restaurant
The pandemic made me realize I couldn't do that anymore
My college education was in pre med
The pandemic also made me realize I couldn't see myself doing that either
I want to change my career to something exciting that I enjoy
and that I can see myself doing long term
Hopefully this is it!
